## 1. Supply Chain

### 1.1 Fundamental Concept

Supply chain refers to the functional network structure that connects suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and end users as a whole around the core enterprises, including the manufacturing, purchasing and delivery of supporting parts, intermediate products and final products through the sales network. The goal of supply chain management is to deliver the right products required by customers to the right place at the right time, in the right quantity, the right quality and the right state, and also at the least total cost. 

From the concept of supply chain, it can be known that supply chain is linked to the suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, retailers and customers, and many other complex entities including person and enterprises. For different industries and products, the supply chain can be formed differently, with different degree of complexity, which may span hundreds of stages, and involve multiple geographic locations around the world, with a cycle lasting for months or even more.

In fact, supply chain comes into being along with the emergence of commerce. With the development of commercial trade, the supply chain has undergone great changes, mainly reflected in the following aspects:

a. Production: manual production has been basically replaced. The production of raw materials, spare parts and products has embarked on the road of industrialization with large scale and high efficiency.

b. Transportation: time of manpower transportation has passed. The basic logistics are realized with truck transportation, ship transportation, railway transportation and air transportation.

c. Sales: the emergence of various electronic sales platforms has gradually replaced the traditional face-to-face transactions. More and more products are sold online.

d. Transactions: product transactions have been implemented electronically, matching sales through the Internet. More transactions are no longer conducted in the form of paper money, but in the form of electronic proofs. 

### 1.2 Basic Elements

In the whole process of purchasing, producing and selling, the basic elements of the supply chain include logistics, flow of capital and flow of information.

a. Logistics: the process by which a product or raw material is transferred to a target, from an upstream supplier to a downstream retailer until it reaches the final customers. In the process of physical transfer of goods from the place of suppliers to the place of receivers, transportation, storage, loading and unloading, packaging, processing, distributing, information processing and other necessary procedures are organically combined to meet the requirements of users according to their actual needs.

b. Flow of capital: it refers to the process of capital settlement, flowing from downstream to upstream. Capital is the blood of an enterprise, and capital flow is the key to invigorate a supply chain. The operating status of capital flow of an enterprise in the supply chain is directly affected by its upstream and downstream counterparties. The operation efficiency and dynamic optimization of the capital flow through a supply chain can directly influence the operation quality of related enterprises.

c. Flow of information: Each party on the supply chain needs to understand and track the current position and status of the products through the chain, and thus the information flows in both directions. The information in commodity circulation includes supply and demand information and management information of the supply chain, which is generated continuously along with the operation of logistics, runs through the whole commodity transaction process and records the flow of the whole business activities. It is an important basis for analyzing logistics, guiding capital flow and making business decisions.

For the supply chain, logistics, flow of capital and flow of information are the three arteries. Logistics points to the demand side, and capital flows to the supply side, while information needs to be shared among all parties. They are united organically in the process of commodity value transformation, and jointly complete the cycle of production, distribution, exchange and consumption, while logistics are guided by information, and capital flow are driven with logistics. 

### 1.3 Current Problems

Supply chain is composed of many participants, and requires a lot of communication and cooperation between different parties. However, the following problems still exist in supply chain management in the actual practice: 

a. The opacity of information affects the overall efficiency of the system. The upstream and downstream participants of the supply chain are playing in a complex game. Due to the information asymmetry caused by time, space, technology and other factors, on the one hand, one party of the transaction can set up trade barriers to gain extra profits, on the other hand, it also increases the overall cost of the system, so that all parties in the transaction cannot obtain the maximum benefits. 

Meanwhile, the trust cost of both parties of the transaction is very high. Due to the information asymmetry, some measures need to be took through the links of the transaction between buyers and suppliers, in order to screen, select and verify the products. The process to gain the trust of other parties increases the transaction costs of both sides.

b. Disputes between supply chain entities are difficult to settle. At present, the supply chain of different industries may cover hundreds of stages, span dozens of geographical regions and involve enterprises across various industries. When there is a dispute between two parties, due to the high complexity of the transaction, it is extremely difficult to provide evidence and the distribution of responsibility is difficult to be clear.

c. Illegal activities are difficult to track. Similar to the problem above, when the products are found to have problems, due to the highly complex structure of the supply chain, it is an extremely time-consuming and laborious work to track the product flow and accurately determine the loopholes.

Besides, due to the present condition of supply chain management that cash flow, information flow and logistics are operated independently around one or more of the core enterprises, so the other participants of a supply chain generally depend on the core enterprise to a great extent. In this mode, the ability of core enterprise to control its upstream and downstream counterparts is very important. At the same time, the change of market supply and demand cannot be transmitted to the supply side in time, resulting the magnifying of risk from market demand to supply side.

## 2. Application of Blockchain in Supply Chain

### 2.1 Advantages

a. The characteristic of Blockchain that information cannot be tampered can match the need of security and traceability for supply chain. 

The operation of supply chain usually involves the cooperation between several participants. When the chain is long, it is inevitable to have quality problems, including the quality damage of physical products or the quality decline of information. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor at certain nodes and trace back when disputes arise. However, information available for monitoring and tracing in the traditional supply chain is often missing, hidden or tampered, so that blockchain can play a big role. When the information related to the products is uploaded into the block, blockchain technology can ensure that the subsequent information dissemination and addition is safe and transparent. Therefore, blockchain is particularly suitable for information security and traceability in multi-party collaboration, such as cross-border transactions. By reading the data stored on the chain, problems such as loss of goods, wrong claims, or commercial fraud can be avoided. This technology is especially suitable for the field of rare commodities. By linking production, logistics, sales and other data, the uniqueness of products can be ensured, the rights and interests of consumers can be guaranteed, and the circulation of fake goods can be eliminated. In addition, when a transaction dispute occurs, related parties can quickly collect evidence according to the information on the chain, clarify the responsibility, and improve the efficiency of payment, delivery and claim settlement.

b. The information of each node of the blockchain is completely consistent, which can weaken the "bullwhip effect" of the traditional supply chain. 

The "bullwhip effect" is a big problem that plagues efficient operating of supply chain. Its main feature is that when the supply chain is composed of multiple links, the volatility of order quantity gradually increases from the end customers to the original suppliers. One of the most critical reasons for the bullwhip effect is the information asymmetry. Suppliers at all levels can only make demand forecast according to the situation of neighboring customers because they cannot see the global information. Therefore, if a 10% margin of safety is added in each level, the amplitude of the order will increase significantly from the downstream to the upstream.

In the blockchain, since all nodes store the same data information, the market demand and inventory level can be seen by the most upstream suppliers and end customers at the same time, which can make more accurate overall judgment without adding too much insurance coefficient in daily operation. This can effectively reduce inventory scales at all levels, thereby improving the cost structure of the supply chain and reducing the occupation of capital. This can also enhance the possibility of multi-party collaboration, information visualization and process optimization, and improves the overall efficiency of the system.

c. Blockchain does not need the involvement of intermediaries, which can reduce the cost of trust.

In the traditional supply chain operation, in order to solve the trust problem, a single central organization is usually formed to achieve the authentication of transactions. The center requires high operation and maintenance costs, and can only have limited access to data.

Compared with the traditional system, the block-chain-based supply chain does not need to entrust a third party as an independent center, and parties on the chain jointly certify the transactions. For example, upstream and downstream enterprises in the supply chain shall jointly establish an "alliance chain", which is only limited to the parties within the supply chain. The alliance chain shall jointly confirm member management, certification, authorization and other behaviors. By recording materials, logistics, transactions and other information on the chain, the information of the upstream and downstream of the supply chain is made public among enterprises, so that the monitoring, auditing and other functions can be notarized by all parties. In this way, transaction injustice, fraud and other problems can be effectively prevented. Blockchain can eliminate the problem of trust, so any two parties in the network can cooperate directly.

d. The "smart contract" of blockchain can reduce relevant manpower input. 

Blockchain is particularly well suited for commodity transactions and information exchanges in "trust deficit" situations. With the "smart contract" technology, we can record the content of the agreement between enterprises in the form of code on the ledger, and once the agreement conditions take effect, the code will be executed automatically. For example, when a buyer transacts from a supplier, it can create a contract on the chain, which is to send the payment to the supplier when the logistics data indicates that the goods have arrived at the place. In this way, as long as the arrival of logistics information issued, the payment will be automatically conducted. Since blockchain data is secure and immutable, the enforceability of code on smart contracts makes default and breach impossible. Due to the characteristics of smart contract that information can be updated in real time with less human intervention, enterprises can realize the dynamic management of supplier team and improve the efficiency of supply chain. 

Meanwhile, by using blockchain technology to upload and share equipment and other relevant information of suppliers, vacant production capacity can be effectively allocated among manufacturers. Small businesses can can cut out the middleman and reduce cost by managing orders automatically and implement production plans accurately with smart contracts.

### 2.2 Cases

a. Security of fresh food. On December 14th, 2017, Walmart, Jingdong, IBM and national engineering laboratory of e-commerce transactions technology of Tsinghua University jointly announced the formation of China's first alliance for safe food, which is aimed to further enhance the transparency of China's food supply chain and ensure food safety for consumers, by utilizing blockchain technology. By using blockchain, the source of a food problem can be traced more easily, which can not only help reduce consumer risk and provide security, but also reduce financial losses through targeted and rapid recalls. Food companies can attach labels to goods, with each assigned a unique identification number. These identifiers record the source of the product, processing information, storage temperature, shelf life and other information.

Taking Walmart’s project in China as an example, the blockchain technology allows consumers to track the digital information of a single pork product, including the farm, the processing factory, batch, storage temperature and transportation details and other related information, in order to determine if a product is real, safe, and whether it has expired. If there is a food contamination incident at a farm or a factory, blockchain could let retailers know which items need to be recalled and which can stay on the shelves. This approach has been applied by Wal-Mart and Jingdong in several categories of fresh food in China at present. Besides, Unilever, Nestle, Tyson and Dole also utilize blockchain for similar application.

b. Logistics and insurance. In 2017, Maersk, the world's largest container carrier, has built a blockchain platform with IBM to improve its container shipping service. The platform is called TradeLens, aiming to help manage and track shipping documentation by digitizing end-to-end supply chain processes. Maersk wants to offer customers end-to-end solutions rather than just shipping containers from one port to another.

According to the research of Maersk, the annual cost of the paperwork needed to process and manage shipping goods accounts for a fifth of the actual cost of physical transportation. Therefore, the platform will speed up transactions and save billions of dollars. And the time for transportation will be reduced by 40% on average. More specifically, participants can use blockchain to track ship arrival time and container arrival time at the depot, while processing customs clearance, commercial invoices, bills of lading, etc. More broadly, TradeLens platform is designed to allow all of the participants, including the shipper, the ship company, freight forwarders, port and terminal operators, inland transportation and customs to communicate more effectively. More than 90 companies and institutions have joined the blockchain platform so far.

## 3. Prospects of Blockchain Application in Supply Chain

The technical characteristics of blockchain naturally meet the needs of supply chain management. First, the chain structure can be understood as a kind of time series data that can store information. This is similar to the pattern in which products are transferred through the supply chain. Secondly, the information transparency of blockchain can solve the trust problem faced by participants of the supply chain. From the perspective of enterprises, real-time understanding of the status of commodities can help enterprises optimize production operation and management, and improve efficiency. Therefore, promoting the application of blockchain technology is in the interests of all business entities.

According to the World Bank, supply-chain-related industries account for about two-thirds of global GDP, and also have the largest number of employees in the world. Based on the current problems in supply chain management and the discussion above, the future development of block-chain-based supply chain has the following trends:

a. Data visualization: information visualization enables all enterprises in the supply chain to have equal rights to view the status of commodities in the circulation process, thus eliminating the information asymmetry in the supply chain and improving the overall efficiency of the system. By reasonably distributing interests, it is possible to increase the profits of all subjects, thus further enhancing the visualization degree of data and forming a consensus on issues such as resisting risks in the upstream and downstream of the supply chain.

b. Process optimization and demand management: through data visualization and coordination between participants, real-time decision optimization and demand forecasting on the supply chain will become possible, thus the “bullwhip effect” can be further weakened or even completely avoided. 

c. Product traceability: through the combination of supply chain and blockchain, comprehensive monitoring and recording of material production, transportation, processing and other procedures can be carried out to obtain more complete process information from the upstream to the downstream of the supply chain, which will help solve problems of traditional system that are mentioned above.

In conclusion, blockchain technology can effectively solve the problems of lagging information transmission and low agility in the traditional supply chain, greatly improve transaction trust, and facilitate process optimization. In practice, the establishment of a systematic IoT is the prerequisite for the combination of blockchain technology and supply chain. Therefore, industries and enterprises with higher degree of automation and standardization are expected to take the lead in the application of block chai. Meanwhile, the combination of blockchain technology and supply chain finance also deserves further attention, for the historical transaction information of enterprises in the supply chain is guaranteed by the blockchain, which can help financial institutions quickly assess the credit of enterprises, reduce the difficulty of financing and fully reflect the enterprise value.
